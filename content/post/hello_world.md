Hello... world?  
They say beginnings are the most important part, I'd say what matters is how frequently you come back to something and start it again.    
This is my 11 attempt (In binary, of course) in having a blog and I decided to make up a static site. (With Hugo and GitHub pages)  
I chose Hugo over Jekyll because Hugo is faster (it's written in Go and whatnot), and frankly, I didn't know anything better.
So far the journey has been easy and pleasing. I had to tweak a few things to make the template the way I wanted, but that's about it.  
Cheers to repeated beginnings,   
Justkim
